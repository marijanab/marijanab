- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marijanab
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the behaviour of different processes and their modelling, simulation, measurement and control.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to:
      - implement an EtherCAT communication network using appropriate hardware and programming software LabVIEW,
      - measure the strain using Fiber-Bragg Sensors.
